I used content of this repo to deploy BEP20 Token to BNB Testnet and info above is that.
If you want to do the same run this:
npx hardhat run --network testnet scripts/deploy.js
but before that create a secrets json file in a format like this

{
    "mnemonic": "Your_12_Word_MetaMask_Seed_Phrase"
}
